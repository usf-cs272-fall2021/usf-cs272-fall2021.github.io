This guide will discuss the logistics and possible topics for exam 1. See the [Syllabus](../syllabus.html) for details on the exam pass requirement.

## Exam Logistics
{: .page-header}

See below for how the exam will be conducted remotely. Generally speaking, expect the exam to take at least an hour. It will be open book and conducted via Canvas. The questions and possible answers will be randomized to help combat cheating.

### Remote Format

The exam will be split into two components: (1) the primary exam conducted within Canvas and (2) a short coding section conducted using Github Classroom. To complete the exam, students must have access to:

| Resource | Login Account | Details |
|:-----------------|:--------------|:--------|
| [Canvas](https://usfca.instructure.com/courses/1597848) | Login using your USF account. | Used to conduct the exam. Will include the necessary Github Classroom link for the coding section. |
| [Github](https://github.com/usf-cs212-spring2021) | Login using your Github account linked to this class. | Used for the coding section. A Github Classroom link will be provided in Canvas that will setup the necessary Github repository. Only code committed and pushed to this repository before the deadline will be used. |
| Eclipse | N/A | Used to import, run, commit, and push code for the coding section. Other IDEs may be used at the students' risk. Students should verify all of the relevant lecture code is runnable from within their IDE! |

The Canvas portion will *not* use Lockdown Browser. You will *not* see your scores or answers after completing the exam until the retake begins.

The exam will be locked with a password. You must join the lecture Zoom livestream to receive instructions and the exam password at the start of lecture time. If you have questions during the exam, you can ask questions privately in chat or raise your hand on the Zoom. If you raise your hand on Zoom, you will be placed in a private breakout room to ask your question and share your screen if needed.

While you have to join the lecture livestream at the start of the exam, you do not have to stay on the Zoom livestream while you take the exam. The Zoom livestream is there to provide you immediate help, not monitor you.

### Timing

The exam will automatically unlock and lock at the start and end times of your enrolled section.

The exam should take around 1 hour to complete, but you will have the entire class time of <i class="far fa-hourglass-half"></i> **1 hour 45 minutes** to complete the exam.

### Question Types

The exam questions may consist of:

  - <span class="control"><label class="radio"><input type="radio" checked> Multiple Choice Questions</label></span>

  - <span class="control"><label class="checkbox"><input type="checkbox" checked> Multiple Answer Questions</label></span>

  - <span class="control"><span class="select"><select style="width: 300px;"><option>Dropdown Questions</option></select></span></span>

  - <span class="control"><input class="input" type="text" value="Fill in the Blank" style="width: 300px;" readonly></span>

  - <textarea class="textarea" rows="2" style="width: 300px; min-width: auto;" readonly>Short Answer and Code Snippets</textarea>

The specific questions, order you see questions, and possible answers may be <i class="far fa-random"></i> randomized. Most questions will be automatically graded by Canvas. Short answer and code snippet questions will be graded manually by the instructor.

### Resources

The exam is open book, with the exception that you **cannot** ask anyone else (such as another student or user on StackOverflow) to answer a question on your behalf.

I recommend preparing to access to the following official Java documentation during the exam:

  - [Java 15 API](https://docs.oracle.com/en/java/javase/15/docs/api/index.html)
  - [Java SE 15 Language Specification](https://docs.oracle.com/javase/specs/jls/se15/html/index.html)
  - [Java SE 15 Documentation Center](https://docs.oracle.com/en/java/javase/15/)
  - [Java Tutorials](https://docs.oracle.com/javase/tutorial/)
  - [Java Glossary](https://docs.oracle.com/javase/tutorial/information/glossary.html)

You should also be prepared to access any of the class materials, including your homework submissions. You might also want to be familiar with `jshell` just in case you want to quickly run Java code.

### Combating Cheating

There is a 0 tolerance cheating policy for exams. Cheating is fundamentally unfair to you, your classmates, me, and anyone that places value in your degree. When it comes to cheating:

  1. You don't need to cheat; you have many opportunities to meet the exam pass requirement.
  1. You don't want to cheat; the consequences of cheating are worse than failing the exam.
  1. You will get caught; I will be looking for it.
  1. It is hard to cheat and you do not have the time for it.

I will provide more context for each of the above points during the exam review.

### SDS Accommodations

Students may receive [exam accommodations](https://myusf.usfca.edu/sds/exam-accommodations), such as additional testing time, through [Student Disability Services](https://myusf.usfca.edu/sds/exam-accommodations). I must receive a notification for accommodation from [SDS](https://myusf.usfca.edu/sds) approximately <strong>one week</strong> before the exam itself.

Contact me on CampusWire to schedule a specific time to take the exam and retake. In most cases, you will start the exam with your section and have additional time past the end of lecture time. I will try my best to actively monitor CampusWire for any exam questions after lecture time ends, but might not be available to answer questions live on Zoom.

## Exam Retake
{: .page-header }

You will have an opportunity to retake the entire exam during the next class period. The final exam 1 score will be the *average* of the original and retake scores. **It is impossible to earn a lower score due to the retake process.** If your retake score is lower than your original score, your original score will be used instead of an average.

The retake is conducted exactly the same as the original exam with a couple of exceptions:

  1. You will have access to your original attempt. You will see which questions you answered right or wrong (but not the correct answers). Keep in mind, however, that the retake will also use randomized questions. The exact questions from your original attempt might not match those in your retake attempt.

  2. The instructor will provide hints in the Zoom livestream on the hardest questions. You must be on the livestream to receive these hints.

The exam retake is optional. If you are happy with your current exam score and received a C or above letter grade, you can skip the retake process. Your original exam score will be used instead.

## Exam Topics
{: .page-header }

The exam will cover topics on all of the lecture slides, homework assignments, quizzes, and additional resources covered thus far in class. This includes:

<table class="table is-hoverable">
<thead>
  <tr>
    <th width="20%">Topic and Code</th>
    <th width="30%">Lecture Slides</th>
    <th width="30%">Practice Quizzes</th>
    <th width="20%">Homework</th>
  </tr>
</thead>

<tbody>
  {% for topic in page.resources.code %}
  <tr>
    <td>
      {{ topic.text }}
      (<a href="{{ topic.link }}">Code</a>)
    </td>
    <td>
      {% assign filtered = page.resources.slides | where: "slug", topic.slug %}
      {% for item in filtered %}
      {% unless forloop.first %}&bullet;{% endunless %}
      <a href="{{ item.link }}">{{ item.text }}</a>
      {% endfor %}
    </td>    
    <td>
      {% assign filtered = page.resources.quizzes | where: "slug", topic.slug %}

</table>

Note that homework is often associated with multiple topics and appears multiple times in the table.

See the [Schedule](/schedule.html) for links to the many videos and recordings made for this content.
