For this project, you will extend your [previous project](project-3.html) to create a fully functional search engine. This is the **last project** for this course and is split into two main components:

  - **Project 4a, Web Crawler:** a [multithreaded web crawler](project-4a.html) using a work queue to build the index from a seed URL. This will be graded like any other [project functionality](project-grading.html), via JUnit tests and Github Actions. You fully must pass the functionality of [project 3](project-3.html) to be eligible to earn credit for this project.

  - **Project 4b, Search Engine:** a [search engine web interface](project-4b.html) using [embedded Jetty](https://www.eclipse.org/jetty/) and servlets to search that index. This will be graded via [code review during finals week](final-review.html) only. You fully must pass the [web crawler functionality](project-4a.html) to be eligible to earn credit for this project.

See each individual project writeup for more details.

The [Project 4B Search Engine](project-4b.html) project will not be code reviewed during the normal semester. It will only be graded during finals week if eligible. See the [Final Code Review](final-review.html) guide for details.
