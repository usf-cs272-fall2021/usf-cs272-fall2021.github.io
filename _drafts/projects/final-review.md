Instead of a final exam, you will have a final code review during finals week. The final code review is the last synchronous code review appointment possible in the semester and the *only* opportunity to have [Project 4 Search Engine](project-4b.html) graded.

Here are some details regarding how your final code review will be handled.

## Appointments
{: .page-header }

**Everyone should sign up for an appointment regardless of how much progress on projects they have made.** You do not need to have an approved Github pull request to sign up for your final code review appointment.

Final code reviews are conducted during finals week from Monday May 17 to Thursday May 20th between 11:30am and 6:30pm Pacific Time. Each final code review appointment is **30 minutes** each.

You may sign up for an appointment using the Canvas scheduler. Look for "Final Code Review" on the calendar. Appointments will be released gradually starting May 3rd and additional availability will be added each day that week.

**Treat your appointment like a final exam**; if you miss it you do not get another opportunity and receive a 0 for any incomplete project grades that required code review. Make sure to check the time zone being used by your Canvas calendar!

## Grading
{: .page-header }

Unlike all other code reviews, you may receive a **partial** project grade during your final project code review. You may receive up to one partial functionality grade and up to one partial code review grade on **consecutive projects** during this appointment.

The projects you will have graded during this appointment depends on your the earliest incomplete project grade after the deadlines (listed in the next section). Based on that, the projects you will have graded are listed as `TBD` in the following table:

Recall that **you can only work ahead by one project** in this class, so it is not possible to receive a grade for [project 4](project-4.html) unless you have completed both the functionality and design of [project 2](project-2.html) and have at least passed the tests for [project 3](project-3.html).

Therefore, if you are not passing the design of [project 2](project-2.html) by the deadline (the first row), you may earn a partial grade for the design (code review) of [project 2](project-2.html) and the functionality (tests) of [project 3](project-3.html). You will receive a 0% on [project 3 design](project-3.html) and both parts of [project 4](project-4.html). If you already have a functionality grade for [project 3](project-3.html), then only [project 2 design](project-2.html) will be evaluated during your appointment.

## Deadlines
{: .page-header }


The projects you will have graded during your final code review appointment depend on how many projects you passed by the following deadlines:

  - **11:59pm May 10 (Mon), Synchronous Code Review Request**: This is the deadline to *correctly* create a pull request on Github requesting a normal synchronous code review appointment and be guaranteed an appointment before the Friday deadline. Requests made after this point are not guaranteed.

  - **11:59pm May 14 (Fri), Synchronous Code Review**: This is the deadline to have a normal synchronous code review appointment and have the result of that code review influence which projects you will have graded in your final code review appointment.

  - **11:59pm May 15 (Sat), Offline/Asynchronous Request**: This is the deadline to *correctly* create a pull request on Github requesting an offline or asynchronous code review and have the result of that offline asynchronous code review influence which projects you will have graded in your final code review appointment.

  - **11:59pm May 16 (Sun), Project Functionality or Design Issues**: This is the deadline to *correctly* create a  issue on Github for a project grade and have it influence which projects you will have graded in your final code review appointment.

**THESE ARE HARD DEADLINES.** For example, if you submit a functionality issue at 12:03am after the deadline, it will NOT influence which projects you have graded in your final code review appointment. Similarly, if you incorrectly create a pull request (for example, never mark it as "Ready to Review") and do not have it corrected by the deadline, it will NOT influence which projects you have graded in your final code review appointment.

These deadlines are designed to balance between fairness for students that have an earlier final code review appointment with also allowing you to continue making some progress up until your final code review appointment. (Also see the extension policy below as well.)

## Extensions
{: .page-header }

I will consider project extension requests, allowing for work to be graded after your final code review appointment. See below for details.

*However, I do not give I (Incomplete) letter grades for this course. All work must be completed a day before the university grade deadline.*

#### Student Eligibility

These extensions are primarily for students that are close to passing the course by their final code review appointment. Students must be meeting both the exam and project pass requirements before the request will be approved.

#### Project Eligibility

Synchronous code review appointments are not available after the end of finals week. This means extensions are not available for project grades requiring a synchronous code review, which includes the final [Project 4 Search Engine](project-4b.html) project.

However, extensions may be requested for up to 1 project functionality grade and up to 1 asynchronous code review for *consecutive* projects. The rule that you may only work 1 project ahead will remain in place, but will include any additional progress you made in the final code review.

For example, suppose you did not pass project 3 design in your final code review appointment and did not complete project 4 functionality in time. If you are meeting the other pass requirements but not earning a C or above in the course, you may request to have one more asynchronous code review of project 3 and submit the functionality of project 4 after your final code review appointment.

Late penalties will still apply, but you may also request to also complete project extra credit as part of your extension as well.

#### Extension Requests

These requests must be made in a private post on CampusWire **within 24 hours *after* your final code review** appointment.

Include a brief 1 paragraph justification, which can range from struggles with remote learning, struggles with physical or mental health, and even poor planning. I only ask that you are honest about why you ended up behind and need an extension.

#### Extension Deadline

The grade deadline is **Thursday, May 27th**; this is the non-extendable university deadline by which I must enter your final letter grade for the semester.

**Therefore the hard deadline for all extensions will be Wednesday May 26th at 11:59pm**, which gives me 24 hours to wrap up the grading and enter the final letter grades.

The projects you will have graded during your final code review appointment depend on how many projects you passed by the following deadlines:

  - **11:59pm Nov 30 (Mon), Synchronous Code Review Request**: This is the deadline to *correctly* create a pull request on Github requesting a normal synchronous code review appointment and be guaranteed an appointment before the Friday deadline. Requests made after this point are not guaranteed.

  - **11:59pm Dec 04 (Fri), Synchronous Code Review**: This is the deadline to have a normal synchronous code review appointment and have the result of that code review influence which projects you will have graded in your final code review appointment.

  - **11:59pm Dec 05 (Sat), Offline/Asynchronous Request**: This is the deadline to *correctly* create a pull request on Github requesting an offline or asynchronous code review and have the result of that offline asynchronous code review influence which projects you will have graded in your final code review appointment.

  - **11:59pm Dec 06 (Sun), Project Functionality**: This is the deadline to *correctly* create a functionality issue on Github and have it influence which projects you will have graded in your final code review appointment.

**THESE ARE HARD DEADLINES.** For example, if you submit a functionality issue at 12:03am after the deadline, it will NOT influence which projects you have graded in your final code review appointment. Similarly, if you incorrectly create a pull request (for example, for a non-passing release) and do not have it corrected by the deadline, it will NOT influence which projects you have graded in your final code review appointment.

These deadlines are designed to balance between fairness for students that have an earlier final code review appointment with also allowing you to continue making some progress up until your final code review appointment. (Also see the extension policy above as well.)
