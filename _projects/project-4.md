For this project, you will extend your [previous project](project-3.html) to create a fully functional search engine. This is the **last project** for this course and is split into two main components: (a) a web crawler to build the index from web pages and (b) a web interface to process queries and search that index. See below for details.

## Part A: Web Crawler

[View Writeup](project-4a.html){: .button .is-primary }

This part requires you to use a work queue to build the index from a seed URL instead of text files.

#### Eligibility

You fully must pass the functionality of [project 3](project-3.html) to be eligible to earn credit for this project.

#### Grading

This functionality will be graded via JUnit  tests ONLY. There will be no code reviews or design component associated with this part of the project.

## Part B: Search Engine

[View Writeup](project-4b.html){: .button .is-primary }

This part requires you to create a [search engine web interface](project-4b.html) using [embedded Jetty](https://www.eclipse.org/jetty/) and servlets to search that index.

#### Eligibility

You fully must pass the functionality of the [web crawler](project-4a.html) to be eligible to earn credit for this project.

#### Grading

There are no functionality tests for this part. It will be graded via code review ONLY. These code reviews will occur during finals week ONLY. See the [Final Code Review](final-review.html) guide for details.
