This guide will discuss the logistics for the exam retakes. See the [Exam Logistics](exam-logistics.html) for information on the original exam attempt.

## Format

The format will be the same as the original attempt.

However, if the exam uses random variants of each question, it is possible students will see a different variant on the retake attempt. Students should pay close attention to each question before copying a response from the original attempt into the retake attempt.

If the exam included code snippet questions setup via Github Classroom, students may modify the exact same repository for the exam retake.

## Modality

The exam retake will be **conducted asynchronously** throughout the week following the exam.

## Timing

The retake will automatically unlock the day following the original exam and will be available for one week. Once unlocked, students will be able to retake the exam at any time and an unlimited number of times until the deadline.

The exam will still be limited to **1 hour 45 minutes** per attempt.

## Grading

The retake score will be the *highest* score of all retake attempts. The final exam category score will be the *average* of the original and retake score.

**It is impossible to earn a lower score due to the retake process.** If students earn a lower score on the retake than the original attempt, the original score will be used instead of an average.

The exam retake is optional. Students that are happy with their current exam score and received a C or above letter grade can skip the retake process. The original exam score will be used instead.

## Resources

Students will have access to the same resources available with the original attempt.

Students will also have access to their original attempt answers after the retake is unlocked. This will include information on whether the answer was incorrect or correct, but will not reveal the correct answer for incorrect questions. Students will also be able to see the same information for each retake attempt.

The instructor will also provide hints on the [course forums]({{ site.data.info.links.forums.link }}) for certain questions.

The retake must still be completed individually; students may not collaborate on the retake and may not receive help from the teacher assistants.

However, students may consult the instructor for help correctly answering **up to two exam questions** in office hours or the [course forums]({{ site.data.info.links.forums.link }}) for the retake. This includes all parts of each question for multi-part questions.

## SDS Accommodations

The same [exam accommodations](https://myusf.usfca.edu/sds/exam-accommodations) applied to the original attempt will be applied to the retake attempts as well.
