## Zoom Lectures and Labs

Regardless of enrolled section, students may *at any time* attend any Zoom livestream or watch the recording of the remote section.

The remote CS 272-01 section will have the highest quality livestream and will be recorded. The in-person CS 272-02 section will have a livestream, but will not be recorded. Both in person and remote students will be able to participate.

The labs will be conducted remotely only. Please attend your scheduled lab section at the start of the semester. It is important we have enough people to assist students with setup issues during that time. Once code reviews begin, labs will convert to teacher assistant office hours. Students may attend either or both lab sections at that time. Since much of lab time will be spent in breakout rooms, labs will not be regularly recorded.

See the [Getting Started with Zoom](/guides/general/getting-started-with-zoom.html) guide if you are unfamiliar with Zoom. Otherwise, on the first day, join the appropriate Zoom meeting for your desired section:

| Section | Date/Time | Zoom Meeting |
|:--------|:----------|:-------------|
| CS 272-01 Lecture | Tue/Thu 12:45-2:30p | [{{ site.data.info.streams.lecture1.room }}]({{ site.data.info.streams.lecture1.link }}) |
| CS 272-02 Lecture | Tue/Thu 04:35-6:20p | [{{ site.data.info.streams.lecture2.room }}]({{ site.data.info.streams.lecture2.link }}) |
| CS 272L-01 Lab    | Fri 12:45-2:30p | [{{ site.data.info.streams.lab1.room }}]({{ site.data.info.streams.lab1.link }}) |
| CS 272L-02 Lab    | Fri 3:30-4:35p | [{{ site.data.info.streams.lab2.room }}]({{ site.data.info.streams.lab2.link }}) |
